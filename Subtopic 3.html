<td>Limited Access to Resources: Unfortuantely, not all students  have technology devices or access to resources to be able to be included in online learning. </td>
<td>Distractions: With devices allowing access to social media at any time, it can create a major distraction for students to maintain full attention to online learning. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Privacy Concerns: With online learning, it requires a lot of personal information to personalize your resources. School districts need to continue to monitor the confidentiality of personal information. </td>
<td>Social Isolation: When students are taught remotely, they can feel isolated from no social interaction. In traditional school settings, students may be offered more one-on-one support from their instructors. With online learning, it can be harder to receieve that assistance right away.

<td> The resource, "Strengths and Weaknesses of Online Learning" from the University of Illinois explains deeper on the benefits and challenges online learning can bring. It mentions different strengths like how accessible online learning is, how accommodating it is to students, and how many resources it provides to allow students to thrive academically. While online learning can bring all of these benefits, it can also cause many challenges. The resource mentions how distractions, social isolation, and limited access to these resources are all challenges students can face when learning online. This resource dives deeper into how these benefits can help academically and how these challenges can create a barrier in the educational journey. Author: University of Illinois
